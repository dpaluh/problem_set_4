Extra Credit: Find another dataset, briefly describe the dataset and columns. Briefly describe the tables you would use and how you would normalize these data. (2pts.) 


Description:
This is the NOAA Significant Earthquake Database, containing information on destructive earthquakes from 1250 CB to present, downloaded on 12/05/2018 from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1


Tables:
This data will be separated into two tables, one about the location of earthquakes, and one about the destructive force of each earthquake. 
A one-to-many relationship exists: one location in table 1 can be linked to many earthquakes in table 2, but a single earthquake in table 2 can be linked to only one location in table 1.


Table 1: 
Column names:
Location_ID (Integer)
Location_Name (String)
Region Code (Integer)
State (String)
Country Code (String)
Country (String)

Primary key: Location_ID  (Integer) 


Table 2: 
Column names:
Earthquake ID (Integer; unique ID for each earthquake)
Year (Integer; year of earthquake)
Month (Integer; month of earthquake)
Focal Depth (Integer; focal depth of earthquake)
Magnitude (Integer; magnitude of earthquake)
Intensity (Integer; intensity of earthquake)
Location_ID  (Integer) ; location of earthquake)
Latitude (Integer)
Longitude (Integer)
Deaths (Integer; number of deaths attributed to earthquake)
Injuries (Integer; number of injuries attributed to earthquake)

Primary key: Earthquake ID (Integer) 
Foreign key: Location_ID (String)
